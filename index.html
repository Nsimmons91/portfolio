     <h4>Bio & Tech Skills</h4>
        <p class="description"> I am an emerging tech professional with a unique background in doula care, now channeling my passion for empathy and support into the world 
            of technology. As I transition into software engineering, I'm leveraging my skills in communication, problem-solving, and attention to detail 
            to build a strong foundation in tech. I'm eager to apply my nurturing approach to creating user-centric solutions and am actively seeking 
            opportunities to grow and learn in this exciting field. My goal is to bridge the gap between technology and perinatal care, making a meaningful 
            impact through innovative applications.
